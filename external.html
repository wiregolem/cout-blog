            <h5 style="margin-bottom:0;">C++: The Complete Reference 4th edition</h5>
            <h6 style="color:#8e8e8e; margin-top:0;">by Herbert Schildt - <a href="https://www.herbschildt.com">https://www.herbschildt.com</a></h6>

            ISBN13: 978-0072226805</br>
            ISBN: 0-07-2226803</br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An instant favorite, it doesn't baby it's readers, its not a guide to learn C++ in a day, nor is it a series of tutorials to make you feel as though you've learned something at the end. Instead, Herbert Schildt has written an extensive reference to the C++ language and it's subset C. Read it through and step toward mastery of the language or thumb it's clearly defined sections to look up a component of the language at your convenience. This book is invaluable. I've purchased it twice and would buy it again if necessary.
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the 5th edition of the book was never published, leaving the 4th edition quite behind on the newest features of C++. Still the book remains a priceless learning tool as the features in the book remain relevant. 
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herb's website is quite barebones and only shows his most recent works.
